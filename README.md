# Name Swipe

# Intro

Name Swipe is a mobile application that helps parents find the perfect name for their newborn.

## Tech Stack

React Native
Expo

## App Features

 - **Country/Language Library**
  - User can choose from several language libaries to choose names that exist in their respective cultures.
  - User can swipe through names, and view information about each name (etymology, country of origin, historical gender association)

- **Name Swipe**
  - Users can swipe through names that are fetched to the front end from an external API
  - Users can "like" or "pass" a name

# Next Steps
The next steps for Name Swipe is to create a backend to save the liked names. I also want to add a persistent  user login as well as have users be able to connect with other users on the app so they can have a shared liked names list. I would also like to add more language libraries to the app, so the app can be more inclusive.
